## Generating the code to local database with Moor(SQLite)

Moor integrates with Dartâ€™s build system, so you can generate all the code needed with 

```flutter packages pub run build_runner build```

If you want to continuously rebuild the generated code where you change your code, run

```flutter packages pub run build_runner watch``` 

instead. After running either command once, the moor generator will have created a class for your database and data classes for your entities.
